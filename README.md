# RancioBot
RancioBot, a bot used from starving people.

## Roadmap
- v1.0.0:
  - (user) get the menu (first, second, side)
  - (user) add/remove fixed and custom dishes to the order
  - (user) see the order
  - (admin) set dishes (first, second, side)
  - (admin) generate the order
  - bot will be available for users from 11:00AM to 03:00PM
  - auto reset menu after 03:00PM
- v1.1.0:
  - profile users: propose same dishes
  - fixed menu pizza

## Proposal
Use an action button as a response for every action, so the user will have always something to do.
